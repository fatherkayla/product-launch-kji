      <h2>Sending love from our garden to yours</h2>
      <p>During the process of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen. However, at night most plants respire like humans, releasing carbon dioxide. Succulents, and a few other plants like orchids and areca palms, keep producing oxygen all through the night. Long story short, our plants rock!</p>

      <h2>1. What kinds of succulents thrive indoors? </h2>
      <p>Pretty much any succulent can thrive indoors under the right 
    conditions! The key is to pick succulents based on where you 
    want to place them and how much sunlight is available. Colorful succulents need really high levels of direct sunlight and aren’t as easy to grow indoors. Green succulents are much cooler for indoor growing. </p>

  <h2>2. Placement tips</h2>
  <p>A succulent in the wild requires upwards of 6 hours of indirect sunlight a day. You will want to ensure your succulent as close as possible to a window. If placement directly by a window isn’t possible, it’s a good idea to choose a succulent that thrives in shade and low light conditions.</p>

      <h2>3. How to water Your succulents (without waterboarding them</h2>
      <p>Succulents are some of the toughest plants around. They are used to drought conditions since they are native to dry, arid environments. The quickest way to become a succulent murderer is by smothering it with too much water. Succulents like to have their roots soaked and then have the soil dry out quickly.  Make sure their roots are wet!</p>

<section class="FAQS">
<div class="one">
  <h2>1. My succulent is shriveling!! Is it dying?? </h2>

  <p> I mean..yeah, but don’t worry. If the upper leaves are wilting or getting dry, then your plant is likely under watered. Go back to a regular watering schedule and it should bounce back. If it’s the lower leaves that are wilting, this is perfectly normal! Succulents regularly shed off lower leaves to help promote new growth.</p>
</div>

<div class="two">
  <h2>2. What if my succulent leaves are yellow and soggy?</h2>
  <p>You are literally water boarding your plant.This is a symptom of overwatering. If you have been watering every week and notice this, try cutting back to every two weeks. They’re just not that into (water) you. To save its life, cut off the affected leaves and stems. Even if the parent plant is too far gone, you may be able to propagate the plant with some of its cuttings.</p>
</div>

<div class="three">
  <h2>3.  what if my succulent’s leaves are turning brown?</h2>
  <p>This is usually a sign that a succulent that prefers indirect light. It is probably receiving too much direct sunlight. Remove the damaged leaves, literally cut them. Then try placing your succulent away from a window. </p>
